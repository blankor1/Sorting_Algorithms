# Sorting_Algorithms
## Implement Quick sort(3 different versions) in Java. 

The merge sort and the heap sort will be added in the future.

In the main function, I have written the test case and the counted the runtime. You can change the "len" variable for different array length and "count" variable for different testing times.

### Quick sort:

  In the function quickSort(), you can choose different function for "partition" process.
